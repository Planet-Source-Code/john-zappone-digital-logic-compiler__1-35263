ÿ@This is a quick tutorial on how to program using DL

Always use ( ); at the end of a function ex.
text( );
now if you dont have those ( ); markups then the compiler will skip the code and leave it out during the run

setuping up the height, width, posX, and posY commands
Alright this is not tricky at all now i did say use ( ); after all commands but this is different these are commands for the function.  Ex
text(Hello);
{
posX=1200;
}

That will set the position of 1200 for the textbox its simple 

Hide and Show functions
this has to be very easy just declare what you want to hide or show using .hide or .show commands. Ex.

text.hide
or
text.show

Well thats a brief tutorial on how to program in DL but there will be many new functions and commands i am hoping to add in API functions if i could.
